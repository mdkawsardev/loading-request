<br>
This loading timing range is connected with the network request.
<br>
Although I made it with a set custom time of 4s, whenever I handle api this method will work the same.
<br>
The difference in api, api sometimes takes a few seconds to fetch data from another server or our server, at the time we have to handle some loading effects with the server requests
